# Introduction
The following report is based on the following scenario: We are given a mobile app to design,
which is aimed at helping individuals with chronic health conditions manage their medication and
doctor appointments. This mobile app should allow users to set reminders, track their medication
usage, as well as schedule meetings with health professionals.

To successfully design this mobile app for the target audience, we must follow a few sets of tasks.
Before starting the design process, we must conduct user research as well as create personas for
this app. We must then map the user journey that illustrates a typical process the user would go
through using the app. Then, we will create wireframes for our app as well as a clickable prototype
using a design tool (Figma). Finally, we will define a usability test plan and reflect on how the UX
design helped us identify the user needs as well as improvements for the app.

# User Research
In this section, we will discuss the methods used to obtain information on how our mobile
application should look and function. After finding a research method, we will create personas
based on our findings. We will include each persona’s goals, motivations and behaviors when
using the app.

The research method used for the purposes of our project will be searching through scholarly
articles using Google Scholar. This method will provide us with very useful statistics and
information regarding the target audience of our chosen application. We know that we are
targeting people with chronic health conditions, and we want to help them manage their
medication/doctor appointments. This means that we should perform research on this type of
individual
.
The first scholarly article used is from the National Library of Medicine(1), it talks about the
prevalence of Multiple Chronic Conditions (MCC), which will provide necessary information
regarding our target audience. As of 2010, 26% of American adults have multiple chronic
conditions, which solidifies the market need for our application. Age is an important factor in this
article, we can derive two personas based on the user’s age (persona 1: older person (65+ y.o),
persona 2: middle-aged individual (40-50 y.o)). According to Ward and Schiller’s findings, MCCs
tend to significantly increase with age(1). We would need to design our application in such a way
that it is very easy to understand and use with all age groups, especially middle-aged adults and
the elderly. Finally, Ward and Schiller have identified that the most common conditions consist of
Arthritis, Diabetes, and Hypertension, we would need to keep those conditions in mind when
designing the app (maybe keep track of blood pressure, glucose levels potentially through
tracking their medication usage etc.).

Now that we know more about the conditions these individuals have and their average age group,
we should do more research on how exactly to design our mobile application to fit their specific
needs. We will use the second scholarly article found, which talks about mobile application
development, specifically for the elderly class(2). Our mobile application should be very reliable
due to the fact that we are dealing with the health of our users, we would not want to convey
false information or not notify the user in time. Notifications should be loud and clear for anyone
to hear and see; the application must use a readable font with big characters and ensure that
navigation within our app is simple enough for anyone to use(2). Finally, scheduling appointments
or talking to a specialist should not be a hassle and should be intuitive to use.

Now that we have a clear idea on who our target audience is, we are ready to create our two
distinct Personas, as well as map their respecting user journeys.
